## How to run

* Before starting the frontend application, the backend server must be launched first:
  * https://github.com/AzuResolute/MThree-Node-Backend/
* Write "npm install" into the terminal to install all dependencies
* Launch the app!
  * On your terminal, run "npm start"

## The Stacks we used

* Node.js
* Express
* MariaDb
* React
* React-Bootstrap

## Suggested Topics to Explore

* **Backend**
  * **Sequelize** - A JavaScript ORM where SQL commands are written in JavaScript Object Notation
  * **Hibernate** - The Java ORM. ORM's makes SQL queries and code much easier
  * **Spring Boot** - A Java web framework that can accomplish what we covered in this app
  * **MongoDB** - NoSQL alternative to MariaDb, MySQL, PostGres, and other relational databases
  
* **Frontend**
  * **React-Router** - Allows a React app to decide what components to show given a URL.
  * **Redux** - State Manager. When your application possesses a sizable amount of components, redux eases state relationship complexity by being a globa state holder and manager. 
  * **Studying more JavaScript** - A lot of what you can accomplish in React uses advanced JavaScript, such as the Array.map.
  * **Studying TypeScript** - JavaScript but with types and interfaces. Use this to make creating web app frameworks such as React easier to debug.
